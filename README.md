 Reverb for the Daisy / kxmx bluemchen 

This is my first attempt at programming for the Daisy (embedded platform for music)
The code is made based on the reverb example and the hardware test for the kxmx bluemchen.
It should be loaded/ made for the kxmx bluemchen https://kxmx-bluemchen.recursinging.com/

I did some adjustments and made some menu's for the oled screen.
Pressing the encoder will scroll thru the menus.

In the menus you should be able to set the routing for the CV inputs and potentionmeters.
